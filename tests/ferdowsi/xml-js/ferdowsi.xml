                    Little is known about <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name>'s early life. 
                    The poet had a wife, who was probably literate and came from the same 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> class.
                    He had a son, who died at the age of <num value="37">37</num>, and was mourned by the poet in an elegy 
                    which he inserted into the <distinct xml:lang="fa" time="ancient"><name type="book" key="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</name></distinct>.

                    <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> belonged to the class of 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name>. 
                    These were landowning <name type="dynastic" key="Iranian">Iranian</name>

                    and whose power, though diminished, had survived into the Islamic era which followed the Islamic conquests 
                    of the <date>7th century</date>. The <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> were attached to 
                    the pre-Islamic literary heritage, as their status was associated with it 
                    (so much so that <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> is sometimes used as a synonym 
                    for "<name type="dynastic" key="Iranian">Iranian</name>" in

                    Thus they saw it as their task to preserve the pre-Islamic cultural traditions, 
                    including tales of legendary kings.

                <p>
                    The Islamic conquests of the <date>7th century</date> brought gradual linguistic and cultural changes

                    By the late <date>9th century</date>, as the power of the

                    several local dynasties emerged in Greater <name type="place" key="Iran">Iran</name>.
                    <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> grew up in <name type="place" key="Tus">Tus</name>, 
                    a city under the control of one of these dynasties, the <name type="dynastic" key="Samanid">Samanid</name>s, 
                    who claimed descent from the <name type="dynastic" key="Sassanid">Sassanid</name>s

                    The <name type="dynastic" key="Samanid">Samanid</name>s bureaucracy used the

                    had ordered his minister <name type="person" key="AbuMansurMamari">Abu Mansur Mamari</name> to 
                    invite several local scholars to compile a prose

                    Although it no longer survives, <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> 
                    used it as one of the sources of his epic. <name type="dynastic" key="Samanid">Samanid</name>s rulers were patrons 
                    of such important <name type="dynastic" key="Persian">Persian</name> poets as <name type="person" key="Rudaki">Rudaki</name> and

                    The poet agreed to receive the money as a lump sum when

                    <name type="person" key="SultanMahmud"><distinct xml:lang="fa" time="ancient">Sultan</distinct> Mahmud</name> prepared to give him

                    However, the courtier whom

                    regarding him as a heretic, and he replaced the gold coins with silver. 
                    <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> was in the bath house 
                    when he received the reward. Finding it was silver and not gold,

                    and the slave who had carried the coins.

                    <name type="person" key="SultanMahmud"><distinct xml:lang="fa" time="ancient">Sultan</distinct> Mahmud</name> eventually learned
