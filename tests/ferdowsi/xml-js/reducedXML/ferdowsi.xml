                <p><name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> was born into a family of 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Iranian">Iranian</name> landowners (<name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name>) 
                    in <date when="940">940</date> in the village of <name type="place" key="Paj">Paj</name>, 
                    near the city of <name type="place" key="Tus">Tus</name>, 
                    in the <name type="place" key="Khorasan">Khorasan</name> region of the 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Samanid">Samanid</name>s Empire, 
                    which is located in the present-day <name type="dynastic" key="Razavi">Razavi</name> 
                    <name type="place" key="Khorasan">Khorasan</name> 
                    Province of northeastern <name type="place" key="Iran">Iran</name>.        
                    Little is known about <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name>'s early life. 
                    The poet had a wife, who was probably literate and came from the same 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> class.
                    He had a son, who died at the age of <num value="37">37</num>, and was mourned by the poet in an elegy 
                    which he inserted into the <distinct xml:lang="fa" time="ancient"><name type="book" key="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</name></distinct>.

                <p>
                    <name type="person" key="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</name> belonged to the class of 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name>. 
                    These were landowning <name type="dynastic" key="Iranian">Iranian</name> 
                    <name type="dynastic" key="Aristocrats">Aristocrats</name> 
                    who had flourished under the <name type="dynastic" key="Sassanid">Sassanid</name>s dynasty 
                    (the last pre-Islamic dynasty to rule <name type="place" key="Iran">Iran</name>) 
                    and whose power, though diminished, had survived into the Islamic era which followed the Islamic conquests 
                    of the <date>7th century</date>. The <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> were attached to 
                    the pre-Islamic literary heritage, as their status was associated with it 
                    (so much so that <name type="dynastic" key="Dehqans">Dehqans</name> is sometimes used as a synonym 
                    for "<name type="dynastic" key="Iranian">Iranian</name>" in 
                    the <distinct xml:lang="fa" time="ancient"><name type="book" key="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</name></distinct>). 
                    Thus they saw it as their task to preserve the pre-Islamic cultural traditions, 
                    including tales of legendary kings.

                    He received generous patronage from the <name type="dynastic" key="Samanid">Samanid</name>s
